:navtitle: Home

== Introduction

This course provides a step-by-step guide to migrating your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) from one deployment type to another. Whether you're moving from an RPM-based to a containerized deployment or transitioning to OpenShift. This course covers best practices, prerequisites, and execution workflows to ensure a smooth migration.

You’ll learn how to:

✔ Assess and prepare your source environment for migration.

✔ Create and validate a migration artifact (database dumps, secrets, configurations).

✔ Import and reconcile data in the target environment.

✔ Troubleshoot common issues and validate post-migration functionality.
