= Fast-track Ansible Automation Platform Migration
:navtitle: Home

== Introduction

This course provides a step-by-step guide to migrating your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) from one deployment type to another. Whether you're moving from an RPM-based to a containerized deployment or transitioning to OpenShift, this course covers best practices, prerequisites, and execution workflows to ensure a smooth migration.

You’ll learn how to:

✔ Assess and prepare your source environment for migration.

✔ Create and validate a migration artifact (database dumps, secrets, configurations).

✔ Import and reconcile data in the target environment.

✔ Troubleshoot common issues and validate post-migration functionality.


Duration: 4 hours

== Objectives

On completing this course, you should be able to:

- Understand Migration Paths
.. Identify supported migration scenarios (RPM → Container, Container → OpenShift, etc.).
.. Recognize out-of-scope components (Event-Driven Ansible, custom CAs).

- Prepare for Migration
.. Verify prerequisites (PostgreSQL 15, network connectivity, backup plans).
.. Document source environment topology and configurations.

- Execute the Migration
.. Export data from the source environment into a structured migration artifact.
.. Import and restore data in the target environment (Container/OpenShift/Managed AAP).
.. Reconcile configurations and validate functionality post-migration.
Test & Validate the migrated content
