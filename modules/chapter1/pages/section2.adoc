= Ansible Automation Platform 2.4

The Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 environment is now fully deployed and ready for immediate use. Below, you'll find the essential access details for the core components: the **Automation Controller** for centralized job orchestration and the **Private Automation Hub** for managing your curated content and Execution Environments with installer managed external database.

. Please create a https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.6/html-single/rpm_installation/index#proc-create-subscription-allocation_obtain-manifest[New subscription, windows=_blank], which is required to activate the Ansible Automation Platform for this exercise. Remember to download the manifest file.

Your immediate next step is to begin populating the platform—curating organizational data such as Ansible Playbooks, Credentials, and RBAC configurations—in preparation for the subsequent upgrade to AAP 2.6 and then migration to containerized or operator-based deployement of AAP 2.6 . 

We've also included a video demonstrating access to the Controller and Hub, along with sample content to guide for your upgrade and then testing that the content is migrated correctly. The video is at a pace where you can follow the implementation side by side.
